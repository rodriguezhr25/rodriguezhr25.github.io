                This website use dark colors for background with white and a very vibrant orange that creates

                household products and many other services. 
                In the design of their website, which is very similar to the app,
                 they apply the Hickâ€™s Law , 
                 offering filters and categories that facilitate the search
                  for required products or services.

                Pathway website is very interesting when we observe several principles design. 
                Clearly, the pattern used in all the pages maintain a standard 
                separation between paragraphs and elements.

                It's easy to follow the reading , 
                instructions and order in the content,
                 because the proximity is well focused, 
                 allowing the understanding of what is related between a 
                 pair of elements or which of them belong to different areas.
